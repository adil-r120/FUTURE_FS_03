# Pitch: How the New "Brew & Bloom" Website Drives Business Growth

## 1. Problem: Limited Online Visibility & Customer Friction
The previous online presence (or lack thereof) was missing critical information that modern customers expect:
- **No Mobile-Friendly Menu**: Customers couldn't easily see what was available on their phones.
- **Hidden Contact Info**: Hours and location were hard to find, leading to lost foot traffic.
- **Lack of Social Proof**: No way for new customers to trust the quality without seeing reviews.

## 2. Solution: A Modern, High-Conversion Web Experience
We built a fast, responsive, multi-page React application designed to convert visitors into paying customers.

### Key Features & Business Impact:

#### 🚀 **Mobile-First Menu & Ordering** (Direct Revenue Driver)
